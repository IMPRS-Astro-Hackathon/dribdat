# Quickstart

This project can be deployed to any server capable of serving Python applications, and is set up for fast deployment using Docker or to the [Heroku](http://heroku.com) cloud:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

The first user that registers becomes an admin, so don't delay! If you would like to run dribdat on any other cloud or local machine, there are additional instructions in the [Deployment guide](docs/DEPLOY.md).

Information on contributing and extending dribdat, as well as running it on your local machine, can be found in the [Developer guide](docs/CONTRIBUTE.md) which includes API documentation and more.
