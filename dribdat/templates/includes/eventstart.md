Planning your next event? Here are some tips from hackathon pros - feel free to skip this dialogue if this is not your first time organizing an event!

### Challenges

The starting point of most hackathons are a set of challenges. These should have a short description of a problem, and potentially initial ideas of solutions which can be realistically attempted during the time constraints of the event. The projects that are developed in response to challenges can be as simple or as complex as desired. Once you create your event page, you can attach challenges to it.

<label><input type="checkbox"> Create a series of **Challenges** by starting projects </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> If you want, you can organize them in **Categories** (Presets)  </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Use the **Getting started guide** below to provide directions to people who start challenges </label><br>

### Teams

While some people like to hack on their own, we believe hackathons are all about collaboration and meeting new people. A team should generally consist of at least two and a maximum of 8 people. You can encourage your participants to join challenges with a profile that includes standard roles that you can define in the _Presets_ menu above. This can help a smooth team-building process.

<label><input type="checkbox"> Decide what **Roles** are appropriate to your event </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Encourage participants to create an online **Profile** </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Facilitate team-building by having everyone try to **Join** a challenge </label><br>

### Resources

Participants bring their own tools into the event, and that is generally encouraged as long as the entire team can use the tools freely (preference to free, open source, cloud-based tools). You can also recommend tools or special offers using projects in a separate "Resources" event page. Teams might also want to work with open datasets, or with data that will attain this status shortly.

<label><input type="checkbox"> Set up a **Resources** event with recommended tools and "bootstraps" </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Provide links in the **Instructions** to collections of open data </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Try to provide clear starting points and engaging options for a range of experience levels </label><br>

### Conduct

In the interest of creating a safe and inclusive environment, we strongly encourage applying a [Hack Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/) to your event. We have provided a boilerplate text at the bottom of every page, which you might also want to include in your opening presentation / e-mailed instructions.

<label><input type="checkbox"> Check the <b>Code of conduct</b> section in your event settings </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Make sure your fellow organisers are aware and ready to enforce it </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Make sure your teams make the data they use, or check that the data are freely and legally available. </label><br>
