Planning your next event? Here are some tips from hackathon pros. _Yes, you can [skip this page](/event/new)._

## üèÅ Challenges

The starting point of most hackathons: a short description of a problem, some initial ideas of solutions which can be realistically attempted during the time constraints of the event. Once you create your event page, you can attach challenges that the teams should respond to.

<label><input type="checkbox"> Create a series of **Challenges** by starting projects </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> If you want, you can organize them in **Categories** (Presets)  </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Use the **Getting started guide** to provide extra directions</label><br>

## üë™ Teams

Some people like to hack on their own - for others, hackathons are all about collaboration and meeting new people. A team generally consists of 3 to 8 people. You can encourage your participants to set up a profile with roles that you can define in the _Presets_ menu to create a smooth team-building process.

<label><input type="checkbox"> Decide what **Roles** are appropriate to your event </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Encourage participants to create an online **Profile** </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Facilitate team-building by having everyone try to **Join** a challenge </label><br>

## üì¶ Resources

When participants bring their own tools, sharing is encouraged as long as the entire team can use them easily and legally (preference to free, open source, cloud-based tools). Using a separate _Resources_ event, you can create project templates, recommend tools or special offers, provide open datasets, and more!

<label><input type="checkbox"> Set up a **Resources** event with recommended tools and bootstraps </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Provide links in the **Instructions** to collections of open data </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Set clear starting points for a range of participant experience levels </label><br>

## ‚òùÔ∏è Conduct

In the interest of creating a safe and inclusive environment, we strongly encourage applying a [Hack Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/) to your event. We have provided a boilerplate text at the bottom of every page, which you may also want to include in your opening presentation or e-mailed instructions.

<label><input type="checkbox"> Check the **Code of conduct** section in your event settings </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Make sure your fellow organisers are aware and ready to enforce it </label><br>
<label><input type="checkbox"> Verify that all data sources are freely and legally available. </label><br>
