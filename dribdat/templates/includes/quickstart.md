### &#128640; Let's launch your idea!

Come up with a **Title** and short **Summary**. Would it be a _Project_, a _Session_ or an _Open discussion_? 
You can use the  **Readme** link to fetch content from a [supported open repository](https://docs.dribdat.cc/sync). 
Need more help? Looks at the projects on the [event page](https://live.imprs-astro-hackathon.de/event/1)
or get in touch with the [organising team](https://imprs-astro-hackathon.de/#team).
