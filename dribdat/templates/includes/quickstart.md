### &#128640; Let's launch your idea!

Give it a fitting **Title** and short **Summary**. Use the **Refresh** link and button to fetch a README from your open source repository on [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org); an online document at [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org), [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) (Published to Web), [Instructables](http://instructables.com), [HackMD or CodiMD](https://hackmd.io) and [DokuWiki](http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/project:home).

Interested contributors can then click the **Join** button at the top of the page to contribute. Once the event begins, they can also edit and expand the content, posting a **Pitch** using plain text or [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Links to videos, documents, a slideshow hosted on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/) and many other [supported sites](https://oembed.com/#section7) will turn into a live preview. Remember to update your progress regularly using the **Post** button.
